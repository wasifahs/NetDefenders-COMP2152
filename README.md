## Vulnerability Report (Sanzida Islam)

### Title:
No HTTPS on api.0x10.cloud

### Description:
The website allows communication over HTTP instead of HTTPS. This means data transmitted between the user and the server is not encrypted. An attacker can intercept sensitive information such as login credentials using a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

### Proof:
Final URL: http://api.0x10.cloud
[!] VULNERABILITY: Site does NOT use HTTPS
→ Data can be intercepted (MITM attack)

## Target

- Server: `0x10.cloud` and its subdomains
- Submission: http://submit.0x10.cloud
- Leaderboard: http://ranking.0x10.cloud

## Important: Rate Limit

The server allows **10 requests per second** per IP address. If you send requests too fast, you will get blocked (HTTP 429). Add a small delay between requests:

```python
import time
time.sleep(0.15)  # wait 150ms between requests
```

## Getting Started

1. Look at the three example scripts:
   - `example_http_check.py` — checks if a site uses HTTPS (uses `urllib`)
   - `example_port_check.py` — checks if a port is open (uses `socket`)
   - `example_header_check.py` — reads HTTP response headers for info leaks (uses `urllib`)
2. Run all examples: `python3 main.py`
3. Create your own branch: `git checkout -b your_vuln_name`
4. Write a Python script that finds and demonstrates a vulnerability
5. Submit your finding at http://submit.0x10.cloud
6. Merge your branch into master when done

## Rules

- **Python standard library only** — `socket`, `urllib`, `ssl`, `json`, `base64`, `time`. No pip packages.
- **Only scan `*.0x10.cloud`** — do not scan any other domain.
- **Respect the rate limit** — 10 requests/second max.
